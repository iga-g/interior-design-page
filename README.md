# Fullpage Website

## Description

It's my new training project - Fullpage Website (subject: page for interior designer) based on [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) and its possibilities.

## Roadmap

I would like to add slider for cards beyond 1024xp width & smooth scroll for anchor 'find me here'.

## Project status

It's completed and fully responsive, but I would like to develop when I learn some new features.
